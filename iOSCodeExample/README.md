This sample project is a part of OSL Community application (https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/osl-community/id719166885?mt=8)

It demonstrates OOP approach to development and contains several classes with implementation of slider-style menu and phones screen (“Viktige number“ in application menu). I prepared it in a way, so that you could easily navigate through it. However, it’s useless to try run it because it does not implement any concrete feature or application screen.

The main classes are: 

- SliderMenuViewController - the main menu controller which contains moving view. 
- SliderContentViewController - controller which used as content for moving part of main menu class.

Some unimportant code was commented.
