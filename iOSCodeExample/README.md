There is a sample project which contains several classes with implementation of slider-style menu and phones screen (“Viktige number“ in application menu). 
This project sample is part of the actual project and I made it so that you can easily navigate through it. However, it’s useless to try run it because it does not implement any concrete feature or application screen.

This part of project demonstrates OOP approach of development. 
Some unimportant code was commented.

The main classes are:
SliderMenuViewController - the main menu controller which contains moving view.
SliderContentViewController - controller which used as content for moving part of main menu class.
